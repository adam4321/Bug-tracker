# Software Bug Tracking application

Application for adding new software bugs and assigning them
to one or more programmers. It displays the percentage of
open bugs to allow the users a sense of the backlog.

The application uses Handlebars to server-side render each
of its pages and then vanilla JavaScript on the client-side
to update pages. The server-side uses Node.js and Express
and the database is MySql which is deployed locally.
